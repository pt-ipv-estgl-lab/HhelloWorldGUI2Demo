# Short GUI program

To give an idea of the types of things that are involved on GUI development, we'll look at a short GUI program that does the same things as the previous program — open a window containing a message and an OK button, and respond to a click on the button by ending the program — but does it all by hand instead of by using the built-in `JOptionPane` class [here](https://github.com/pt-ipv-estgl-lab/GhelloWorldGUI1Demo). This also demonstrate namespaces, using `package` instruction.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
